			<p>Now, Ray is ready to turn over the business to a younger 
			generation. His company will be succeeded by the new Ray Plumbing 
			and Heating run by two of his sons, George Jr. and Daniel, and his 
			son-in-law, Earl Archer.</p>
			<p>They don’t expect to make any major changes.</p>
			<p>“His way has worked good for 40 years, why change it?” said 
			George Jr. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”</p>
			<p>“I expect it will be business as usual,” Archer added.</p>
			<p>For the past several years, George Jr. and Archer have managed 
			the business during the winters while the elder Ray and his wife, 
			Betty, have been in Florida. They will be joined by Daniel who for 
			the past decade or so has run his own plumbing business.</p>
			<p>Ray was drawn to plumbing naturally, but not without some 
			objections. His father and four “big” brothers were plumbers, so he 
			had an early exposure to the business. But his mother wanted him to 
			do something else. So, after graduating from Ellsworth High School 
			in 1950, young George went to work for a local dry cleaner.</p>
			<p>When the business needed an overhaul, George’s father was hired 
			to do the plumbing and George helped out.</p>
			<p>“There was a lot of piping to be done, and I just loved it,” he 
			said. “When the job was done, I was just bored to tears. I knew I 
			wanted to do something mechanical.”</p>
			<p>He left dry cleaning and worked two winters with his brother in 
			Florida, spending summers working for the Babson and Duffy plumbing 
			company in Blue Hill.</p>
			<p>“I learned an awful lot from them,” he said.</p>
			<p>But in the spring of 1957, things were slow for Babson and Duffy, 
			and Ray did some jobs on his own while waiting for business to pick 
			up. </p>
			<p>“For two weeks, I had all kinds of work,” he said. “I got my 
			master plumber’s license on May 15, and I thought I’d give it a try 
			on my own and see what happened.”</p>
			<p>He hasn’t looked back since. </p>
			<p>Ray ran the business from his home, with his wife, Betty, serving 
			as bookkeeper and later as comptroller, a post she filled until her 
			retirement in 1995. </p>
			<p>“Betty has been a constant part of the business,” he said. “She 
			retired in 1995, but she still looks over our shoulders, even now.”
			</p>
			<p>By 1959, Ray Plumbing and Heating had six employees, two of whom, 
			Bob Seavey and Gordon Grindle, are still with the company. That was 
			the year Ray bought the former J.P. Eldridge Co. and moved into the 
			company’s building located at what is now One Printing House Square, 
			which houses The Ellsworth American’s presses. Still growing, the 
			company moved to High Street in 1962 and then to its present 
			location off High Street in the 1980s. The facility includes the 
			company’s offices, a parts and repairs department and the showroom.</p>
			<p>Although the showroom contains primarily home fixtures, which 
			account for a portion of the company’s business, Ray Plumbing and 
			Heating also has made a name for itself in the world of commercial 
			and industrial projects.</p>
			<p>“We’ve seen a lot of changes in Ellsworth and we’ve done parts of 
			major projects as they’ve come along,” he said. “We did the original 
			Ellsworth Shopping Center and the Maine Coast Mall. I’d guess we’ve 
			been involved with about two-thirds of the buildings that have been 
			developed here over the years.”</p>
			<p>But the company’s efforts have not been restricted to Ellsworth. 
			They’ve done hospital, hotel and apartment building jobs throughout 
			eastern Maine including projects at the Mid Maine Medical Center in 
			Waterville, Parker Ridge in Blue Hill, St. Joseph’s Hospital in 
			Bangor, Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth and The Jackson 
			Laboratory in Bar Harbor. Ray also did the work for the Mount Desert 
			Island High School, one of the company’s first big jobs. </p>
			<p>“That was one of those jobs that just went along smoothly,” he 
			said. “It was something I was really proud of when we were 
			finished.”</p>
			<p>One of the most challenging projects Ray has done was for the 
			Robertson Lumber Co. in Searsmont where he helped the company start 
			generating its own power.</p>
			<p>“We designed a wood furnace and a steam boiler so they could burn 
			scrap wood to generate electricity,” he said. “It was a big task and 
			it was a learning experience. It wasn’t anything I’d run into 
			before, so I had to do some studying. It was fun.”</p>
			<p>Fun and quality service have been the two hallmarks of Ray’s 
			company from the beginning, he said.</p>
			<p>“One thing that has made us successful is that we’ve always tried 
			to do the best job we possibly could and we’ve always been honest 
			with people,” he said. “And the customers and employees have always 
			been my friends. That’s something I’ve always felt. It’s always made 
			work fun. It’s been fun for me and I’ve tried to make it fun for 
			everyone who worked with me.”</p>
			<p>Over the years, Ray has been active in community and industry 
			organizations. He has been president of the Maine Plumbers 
			Association, and served three terms on the association’s examining 
			board, including a stint as the chair of that board. In addition, he 
			held classes at his business for his own employees and others in the 
			area. </p>
			<p>He served on the Energy Conservation Task Force for the National 
			Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors.</p>
			<p>He has served on the board of directors for the James Russell 
			Wiggins Down East Family YMCA for 16 years, serving two terms as 
			chair of that board. He chaired the board during the planning for 
			the construction of the Y facility on Outer State Street.</p>
			<p>A member of the Ellsworth Area Chamber of Commerce, Ray also has 
			served on the board of Maine Coast Memorial Hospital&nbsp; and has been a 
			member of the Rotary for 32 years. He also started the northern 
			division of the Maine State Golf Association. </p>
			<p>He’s an avid bridge player and he also loves to golf. He boasts 
			five holes in one during the past two decades, one of which won him 
			a new car.</p>
			<p>While he plans to follow those pursuits, Ray will not leave the 
			business altogether. He will still have an office next to his son’s, 
			and last week was still busy inspecting prospective projects and 
			figuring estimates.</p>
			<p>“I still do some estimates and I solve problems,” he said, 
			pointing to pages of pressure readings and diagrams he’s prepared 
			for a job. “Some of those problems take a lot of concentration. 
			That’s what I do best.”</td>
